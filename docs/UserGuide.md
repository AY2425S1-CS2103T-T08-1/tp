1. **Understanding the Basics**

DLTbook is a powerful tool that helps you manage contacts and DLT public addresses.
If you're not familiar with these terms, don't worry‚Äîthis section breaks down the essential concepts.
<box type="info" seamless>

**What is Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)?**

DLT refers to a digital system for recording transactions of assets in multiple places at once.
Unlike traditional databases, DLTs do not have a central administrator, which means blockchain records are
decentralized.

**Why is DLTBook useful in managing contacts?**

DLTbook simplifies the task of managing contacts linked with DLT public addresses,
ensuring secure and efficient interaction with distributed networks.

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines

### Saving the data

DLTbook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save
manually.

<br>

### Editing the data file

DLTbook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are
welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

**Caution:**

If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, DLTbook will discard all data and start with an empty data
file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>

Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside
the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>

**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Common Errors

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only
   the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the
   application before running the application again.

2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut
   `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to
   manually restore the minimized Help Window.
