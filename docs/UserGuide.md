## Beginner's Guide

<panel header="üëã **Welcome to DLTbook Beginner's Guide**" type="primary" expanded>

_If you're new to DLTbook or the concept of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), this guide will walk you through the
basics. Here, we'll cover key concepts, important terminology, and guide you through the first steps in using DLTbook._
</panel>

<br>

1. **Understanding the Basics**

DLTbook is a powerful tool that helps you manage contacts and DLT public addresses.
If you're not familiar with these terms, don't worry‚Äîthis section breaks down the essential concepts.
<box type="info" seamless>

**What is Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)?**

According to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralized-technology-dlt.asp), Distributed Ledger
Technology (DLT) is the technological infrastructure and protocols that allow simultaneous access,
validation, and record updating across a networked database. DLT is the technology blockchains are created from, and the
infrastructure allows users to view any changes and who made them, reduces the need to audit data, ensures data is
reliable, and only provides access to those that need
it.
</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Why is DLTBook useful in managing contacts?**

DLTbook simplifies the task of managing contacts linked with DLT public addresses,
ensuring secure and efficient interaction with distributed networks.

</box>

2. **Key Terms You Should Know**

Before diving in, let's clarify some essential terms:

<box type="info" seamless>

- **Blockchain/Network**: A decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers.
  Acts like a currency, but it's digital and secure. (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana).

- **Software Wallet/Wallet**:  A software wallet, also known simply as a wallet, is an application that exists on a
  connected device such as a phone or computer. It is always connected to the internet. (
  Source: [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/security/what-is-a-software-wallet))

- **Wallet Name**: A label that you use tag to the wallet to identify the wallets purpose
- (for daily transactions, for decentralised fiannce transactions, for long term storage).

- **Public Address**: A public address is a unique series of cryptographic codes that can be shared with others to
  receive messages, coins, or tokens. (similar to an
  account
  number). (Source: [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/security/what-is-a-software-wallet))

- **Command Line**: A text-based interface used to run commands on your computer.

- **Java**: The programming language required to run DLTbook.

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Editing the data file

DLTbook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are
welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

**Caution:**

If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, DLTbook will discard all data and start with an empty data
file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>

Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside
the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## Common Errors

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only
   the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the
   application before running the application again.

2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut
   `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to
   manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **Limited names allowed** The names of contacts in DLTbook do not support special symbols and only accepts characters
   from the English alphabet.
4. **Missing email validation** The email field of contacts in DLTbook have no restrictions and can be duplicated across
   contacts.

## Future Enhancements

Most commands currently do not forgive extraneous inputs for commands that do not require them.
Such inputs will be ignored. But the error message displayed for this error for commands are different and may not
exactly describe this error. This shall be fixed in the future.
